            <h2 id="projsum">Project Summary</h2>
            <p id="psum">I will be updating my MadLibs project by improving the visual design and functionality to meet the new functionality/ purpose of the Madlib. </p>

            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>The Mad Lib from Project 2 generated a verse or a portion of a song called Mosquito. The artist and writer of the song, Pink Pantheress is well known for her short, but catchy songs.</p>
            <p>From the examples shared in class, we were given two methods.I went with the first method which made me code for each input individually. My updated version would need more which would make the first method not the best option. I am hoping to code a whole song.</p>
            <p>I will try using the second method which would make the code more efficient with less. If time allows it I hope to make it interactive from the methods I have learned for the Game On project. Certain things I will include:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>A description/guide/ instructions of the concept of the site. This will manifest into an overlay or ? button in the header.</li>
                <li>I would like to highlight the certain inputs that are missing in order to submit the form: either using a highlight the input bar or a sentence below that states which ones are missing.</li> 
                <li>Overall, I would like to improve the visuals and concept; this can include animation, images, and more cohesive color palette.</li>   
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h2>Expert Feedback</h2>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>I will get visual critique from one of the tutors and another student not from the class. I will receive another critique from another design professor or Mead.</li>   
                <li>I will focus on getting a code review from the graduate student TA and Mead. If times allow I will share it with some other people with Computer Science experience.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
