            <h2>Final Report</h2>
           <p>
            I presented my code to Mead and one developer friend that is familiar with JavaScript. They are my Project Manager for the CodeLab Learning Tool Team. They are very experienced with code as they help lead and teach developers from our team and other projects.
           </p>

           <p>
            I made them familiar with the content I have learned this quarter and my previous projects. This was done in order to show my limitation in knowledge and how I develop my code. I shared the MadLIb templates (Part 1 and 2). I mentioned I used the code from Part 2 to create a loop. The code was in its early stages of development and before I included the visual designs. I showed them some errors that occurred from labeling and wanted to see how I could display the verses better on the page.
           </p>

           <p>
            Most of their critiques were on how to improve the usability of certain functions.One thing they noticed was that the ? button disappeared as I scrolled the page. They recommended making the button sticky as it is already on the page. They noticed I had also used three overlays in my original code but said this can cause issues as they already noticed errors due to simple confusion. They noted I should improve how the information on the main page is displayed and make sure the content is clear so I would not have to use so many overlays. I reduced it down to 2. 
           </p>

           <p>
            They were able to help with the small error in my code. However, they noted I still need to think about how I will structure the content because it seemed like I was adding code as I went on and this caused conflict.
