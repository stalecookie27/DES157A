            <h2>Reserch Form Design: "Best Practices for Form Design" </h2>

            <p>
                This is a generalized summary of the “Best practices for Form Design”. The best practice is to apply the most useful tips from the list to the appropriate use/purpose. As mentioned in the beginning of the article, the ultimate goal is to be the best solution and option for the user. It is crucial to be clear, simple, and direct with our desired action from the user. This can influence the impression of the brand on the user and can make it less desirable for them to use/complete. Some of the tips mentioned in the article I am already familiar with or have strong opinions on based on my own experience as a user.  Some of the tips I like are below.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remember the “Less is More” theory. It is important to only ask/share the important and relevant information to reduce cognitive load.</li>
                <li>Provide a clear picture of the number of steps it takes to complete the process. Providing a percentage of completion and chunking information can make to easier to complete (process)
                </li>
                <li>Specify the clear instruction needed to complete the input. This can be done with support text or completion signage.</li>
                <li>If you need to show an example do it below not inside the input</li>
                <li>Even though it is symmetrical, having the same size input box can confuse the users about how much should be imputed. 
                </li>
                <li>Default input can cause more issues than having an easier process.</li>
                <li>Provide Matching KeyBoards: Easier to type out if its only number</li>
                <li>Asking to input the password twice can increase interaction cost but does not guarantee that users will not make a mistake. </li>
                <li>Give feedback on the form completion, errors. Be direct and nice about it. </li>
                <li>Allow users to use it in the best way they are able to. 
                    Proper contrast, controllable text, label attributes, don’t rely color to communicate statuss </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                One additional note I have is it is hard to include every tip because we also have to consider how much information we have displayed. In other words, having too much information can make it harder for users to find or read through. There must be some cost or affordance in the way we display information to get a specific action. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The CalFresh online application is an example of an updated forum that has highly considered the user’s experience. The form uses a San Serif font that makes it easier to read unlike other government sites. Even though the forum is long it provides an outline of the information needed and expected time. As you go through the form, it updates you on how much is needed and rewards you for completing a part. What is most important is the messages are short and clear; reducing the amount of content on the page which is easier for users to digest and use.

            <h2>
                Overlay Design Pattern Reserch: Overuse of Overlay and How to Avoid Misusing
            </h2>
            <p>
                An overlay is an element that appears on less than 50% of the main window calling to a specific action or task before continuing on the main page. The main uses for the modal window is to grab the user’s attention, obtain user input, or show relevant information. In other words, this is intended to get users to view content, complete a form, or make a decision. Most users find them annoying or disruptive when it is one of the first things they encounter on a site. There is some things that must be considered if we choose to use an overlay such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Avoid multiple navigation mechanisms (scroll) - this function is small so keep it short and sweet. A lot of information will need more space. When regarding the content of the page, it is important to consider if the content is best presented better in a large (full) window?
                </li>

                <li>
                    One of the most important things to do is make it easy to exit or use the modal. The functions are a cancel button, close button, escape key, or to click outside the modal window. Buttons should produce a desired outcome and the module should contrast from the main page by lightbox effect.
                </li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Reseach</h2>
            <p>
                The article encourages us to reevaluate the way we think and construct an image and its meaning. The tips or the skills recommended in the article take time to develop. Like in design, we must take the time to observe, research, create, and build on our creation continuously. It is important to build on others' feedback or observations.
            </p>

            <p>
                I found the Tanya Timal studio website of their portfolio. Their website is incredible and beautiful. The ux/ux is reflective of the artist's style and work. Tanya defines their work as sensual and soft, dramatic lighting. In all aspects and interactions, the site is responsive to support that image. For example, when a page refreshes, some shots shuffle in the middle of the window before the content. The main page shifts different shots of their work, with soft warm colors and an editorial style (in ui/ux). Their portfolio is reflective of their style and skills in all aspects which makes the site so memorable.

            <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                This is one of my favorite pictures from my trip to SK this summer. My friends and I discussed how much we liked action shots from pinterests girls that look natural and good. And I like taking pictures of my friends and the designs from the country more than anything else on the trip. I thought the picture was interesting because it gave the location and showed the shop signs in the back. I liked the different typography from signs, ads, or messages from the country as well as the natural landscape. The image just captures the small moments that actually are really meaningful to me. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I asked Riley to review my image and they liked the image. They knew I was in a foreign country based on the words and letters on the sign. They assumed it was SK based on the language. They found the most interesting parts were all the signs in the picture and everything else in the background. It made them want to look at the image more closely and ask questions about the stores in the back. One of the most obvious parts was that it was Seoul and in a city. The mysterious part was because no one is facing the image, everyone in the pictures has a hidden identity.

            <h2>Game Design UX Best Practices</h2>
        <p>
            It is important to remember the suggestions made in the article are ´not rules´but can be applied on a variety for the most optimal performance. One notable thing mentioned in the article is how the author mentions game designers affect the human brain and it is in our best practice to optimize according to data-driven insight. We have the ability to affect the user as much as they are able to. With constant feedback we can optimize the design of the subject and, in this case, our game. 
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the most applicable observations I noticed is the UI positioning. Almost all the tips could be applicable to the utilization and position of objects on the screen. The screen’s real-estate is limited and more considering the restricting reach when the users tap the screen. The device has a comfort-to and hard-to reach area which is determined how far the user's thumb or stylist can extend. This means the area closer to the bottom of the screen is easier to use compared to the top of the screen. This is applicable to:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sliders: horizontal and vertical sliding function</li>
                <li>Placement of button, ads, etc at the bottom of the screen; What you want at the bottom; What you like to restrict at the top (invisible buttons)
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            It is important to also consider how we present information through diction or function to the users. We should use popups when we need to share important or directive information to the user. The best is to associate it with a function like store or setting and to avoid simply adding “x” or close. A better alternative is to use complete, done, continue, etc. You can determine the frequency you want the pop up to appear and why (for reward, for completion).
